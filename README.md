# The βook of βitcoin

**Live at [bookofbitcoin.io](https://bookofbitcoin.io/)**

Bitcoin verbatim — a Bitcoin block, read as a chapter: each transaction
rendered as a paragraph of grammatically correct [Glossia](https://glossia.io/)
prose, with witness data collected as footnotes. Installable as a PWA and
offline-capable.

Originally part of the [asherp/glossia](https://github.com/asherp/glossia)
repository; the book now lives here, while the Glossia engine (the Rust core
compiled to WASM) is consumed as a published
[crates.io release](https://crates.io/crates/glossia), pinned in
`build_web.sh` — so the book always builds against a released engine version.

## Layout

- `web/bitcoin-book.html` — the book: fetches a block from a configurable
  esplora-style endpoint (Blockstream, mempool.space, or your own node) and
  renders it as prose
- `web/bitcoin-contents.html` — table of contents / notable blocks
- `web/btc-tx.js`, `web/btc-prose.js`, `web/btc-citation.js`,
  `web/btc-contents.js` — transaction parsing, prose composition, citations,
  and contents data
- `web/glossia-msg.js` — the encoding pipeline over the Glossia WASM engine
- `web/glossia.js`, `web/glossia_bg.wasm` — **build artifacts** (gitignored),
  produced by `build_web.sh` from the published glossia crate
- `web/sw.js`, `web/bitcoin-book.webmanifest`, `web/icons/` — PWA shell

## Building & running locally

Requires Rust and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).

```sh
./build_web.sh                # fetches the pinned glossia crate from crates.io
python3 -m http.server -d web 8080
```

Set `GLOSSIA_DIR=/path/to/glossia` to build an unreleased local checkout of
the engine instead.

Serve over HTTP, not `file://` — ES-module imports are CORS-blocked on
`file://` and the page never reaches its ready state.

## Updating the engine

The engine version is pinned by the `GLOSSIA_VERSION` default in
`build_web.sh`. To move to a new engine: publish the new glossia version
(push a `vX.Y.Z` tag in asherp/glossia — its publish workflow does the rest),
then bump the pin here. The pinned version must exist on crates.io before this
repo's builds can succeed.

## Deployment

- `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` — on every push to `main`, builds the
  WASM from the pinned glossia crate and deploys `web/` to the `gh-pages`
  branch, served by GitHub Pages at [bookofbitcoin.io](https://bookofbitcoin.io/)
  (`web/CNAME` keeps the custom-domain binding across deploys).
- `.github/workflows/pr-preview.yml` — deploys a live preview of every pull
  request under `pr-preview/pr-<N>/` and comments the URL on the PR.

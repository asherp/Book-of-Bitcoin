The only two transactions ever confirmed twice, each in four printings between them. Two miners running the same default configuration produced byte-identical coinbases, and nothing in the rules yet forbade it — so each second printing overwrote its first in the set of spendable outputs and destroyed that reward. The book prints all four, because all four were written.

BIP30's ban on duplicate transaction ids switched on by timestamp (15 March 2012) rather than by flag block, with exactly these two offenders grandfathered forever: a rule that had to be written around the record instead of over it. BIP34 later closed the hole structurally — a coinbase must state its own height, so two blocks can no longer write the same one.

Each printing owns its own page here. Pages count positions in the chain, not distinct transaction ids, so the book's page count runs exactly two past the chain's count of distinct transactions — and these are the two.
